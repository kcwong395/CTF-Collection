# Broken String

A file named "broken_string.png" is given

![](broken_string.png)

Convert "VEZ7dGg0dF93NHNfYV" from base64 to ascii and get "TF{th4t_w4s_a"

A logical relationship can be made that appending the first broken part is "HKCTF{th4t_w4s_a"

Similarly, inputing "TDNfcXUzc3RpMG" and we can observed that the result is "L3_qu3sti0"

I made a guess that the missing part is "n}", inputing "0n}" results in "MG59"

This matchs the last part of the broken string "MG"

So the string is now "HKCTF{th4t_w4s_a(unknown)L3_qu3sti0n}"

I thought the word might be simple, converting i to 1

The recovered flag is "HKCTF{th4t_w4s_a_s1mpL3_qu3sti0n}"
